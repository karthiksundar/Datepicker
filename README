This folder will contain plugins created using JQuery

The plugin for datepicker is added in the same path with the name datepicker.js.

The js file contains JQuery code for creating a date picker. The date picker allows selection of a particular date 
by clicking on year, month and day. It also allows entering the date by typing directly. 

The code to be called in the javascript for creating this date picker  is 

$(X).touchDate();

where X is the HTML selector of the parent in which the date picker is to be added.
